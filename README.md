Abstract

This paper investigates graph neural networks (GNNs) applied for self-supervised intrusion and anomaly detection in computer networks. GNNs are a deep learning approach for graph-based data that incorporate graph structures into learning to generalise graph representations and output embeddings. As traffic flows in computer networks naturally exhibit a graph structure, GNNs are a suitable fit in this context. The majority of current implementations of GNN-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) rely on labelled network traffic. This limits the volume and structure of input traffic and restricts the NIDSsâ€™ potential to adapt to unseen attacks. These systems also rely on the use of node features, which may reduce the detection accuracy of these systems, as important edge (packet-level) information is not leveraged. To overcome these restrictions, we present Anomal-E, a GNN approach to intrusion and anomaly detection that leverages edge features and a graph topological structure in a self-supervised manner. This approach is, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful and practical approach to network intrusion detection that utilises network flows in a self-supervised, edge-leveraging GNN. Experimental results on two modern benchmark NIDS datasets display a significant improvement when using Anomal-E compared to raw features and other baseline algorithms. This additionally posits the potential Anomal-E has for intrusion detection on real-world network traffic.
